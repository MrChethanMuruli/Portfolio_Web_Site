1) About Me
Hi, I'm Chethan P M, a B.Tech graduate in Civil Engineering from Bangalore. Although I began my academic journey in construction and structures, Iâ€™ve recently discovered a deep passion for building digital solutions instead â€” which led me into the world of web development.

My transition into tech was driven by curiosity and the thrill of creating interactive web applications. Iâ€™ve since immersed myself in learning web technologies, and Iâ€™m now actively working towards becoming a Full Stack Developer. With a growing foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python, and C#, Iâ€™m currently focused on mastering the backend using ASP.NET and the MVC architecture.

2) About Me 2 (Alternate Perspective)
Beyond code, I value clean design, user-friendly interfaces, and the art of solving real-world problems with tech. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and adaptability â€” traits that helped me make the leap from civil engineering to software development.

In my free time, youâ€™ll probably find me tinkering with small app ideas, watching tech tutorials, or exploring new tools that make development faster and more efficient. I see challenges as opportunities to grow, and Iâ€™m excited about collaborating with other developers, designers, and thinkers who share the same drive.

3) Services Offered
As an aspiring full stack developer, I currently focus on:

Front-End Development
Crafting responsive and interactive web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I aim to make user experiences smooth, intuitive, and visually appealing.

Back-End Development
Learning and building robust server-side applications with .NET (C#), ASP.NET, and MVC patterns. I enjoy working on logic, data management, and creating RESTful APIs.

UI/UX Design (Beginner Level)
I have a growing interest in UI/UX principles and am learning to design with empathy â€” prioritizing usability and accessibility in every project.
